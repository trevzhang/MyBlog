# 绿皮书里Tony写给Dolores的信
Dear Dolores
When I think of you, I’m reminded of the beautiful plains of Iowa. The distance between us is breaking my spirit, My time and experiences without you are meaningless to me. Falling in love with you was the easiest thing I have ever done. Nothing matters to me but you. And everyday I am alive, I’m aware of this. I loved you the day I met you, I love you today…And I will love you to rest of my life.

Dear Dolores
The trees have shed their leafy clothing and their colors have faded to grays and browns, I saw millions of trees, all dusted with snow, just like out of a fairytale…I would count the hours, minutes, and seconds until you are in my arms. I love you and miss you more than I can explain.

Dear Dolores
Sometimes you remind me of a house.A house with beautiful lights on it，where everyone is happy inside…
